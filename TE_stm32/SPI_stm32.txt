Stm32F1 as master, arduino uno as slave

    Convertir codigo de un F1 a un G4??

    Este otro es similar, pero el codigo del stm32 es con cubeMX

SEGUN CHAT**

. Hardware Connections
STM32 to Arduino (SPI Communication)
STM32 SCK (Clock) -> Arduino SCK
STM32 MOSI (Master Out Slave In) -> Arduino MOSI
STM32 MISO (Master In Slave Out) -> Arduino MISO
STM32 CS (Chip Select) -> Arduino pin (choose any digital pin)
Ground (GND) -> GND
Arduino to nRF24L01 (SPI Communication)
Arduino SCK -> nRF24 SCK
Arduino MOSI -> nRF24 MOSI
Arduino MISO -> nRF24 MISO
Arduino CSN (Chip Select Not) -> nRF24 CSN
Arduino CE (Chip Enable) -> nRF24 CE
Ground (GND) -> GND
Power (3.3V) -> VCC (Ensure nRF24 gets 3.3V, not 5V)

Important Considerations
Voltage Levels: Ensure that the voltage levels are compatible between STM32, Arduino, and nRF24L01. nRF24L01 typically operates at 3.3V.
Timing and Synchronization: Proper synchronization must be ensured to avoid data corruption.
Interrupt Handling: Carefully handle interrupts on the Arduino to ensure reliable data reception from the STM32.
Libraries and Drivers: Ensure that you have the correct libraries installed for the nRF24L01 module on the Arduino (RF24 library is commonly used).
